Rfiding is a project to restrict access to machines and doors in a makerspace, hackerspace or open workshop.

It was developed for use at Dingfabrik in cologne germany, but should be easily adaptable to other spaces.

Currently we are working towards a 1.0 release, which has the goal of being stable and having documentation regarding setup and usage in other spaces.
